## Module description

The Puppet dsc_lite module allows you to manage target nodes using Windows PowerShell DSC (Desired State Configuration) Resources.

### Windows system prerequisites

At least PowerShell 5.0, which is included in [Windows Management Framework 5.0][wmf-5.0].

## Setup

~~~bash
puppet module install puppetlabs-dsc_lite
~~~

See [known issues](#known-issues) for troubleshooting setup.

## Usage

The generic `dsc` type is a streamlined and minimal representation of a DSC Resource declaration in Puppet syntax. You can use a DSC Resource by supplying the same properties you would set in a DSC Configuration script, inside the `properties` parameter. For most use cases, the `properties` parameter accepts the same structure as the PowerShell syntax, with the substitution of Puppet syntax for arrays, hashes, and other data structures.

A DSC resource specified in PowerShell:

~~~powershell
WindowsFeature IIS {
  Ensure => 'present'
  Name   => 'Web-Server'
}
~~~

Would look like this in Puppet:

~~~puppet
dsc {'iis':
  resource_name        => 'WindowsFeature',
  module      => 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration',
  properties  => {
    ensure => 'present',
    name   => 'Web-Server',
  }
}
~~~

For the simplest cases, the above example is enough. However there are more advanced use cases in DSC that require more custom syntax in the `dsc` Puppet type. Since the `dsc` Puppet type has no prior knowledge of the type for each property in a DSC Resource, it can't format the hash correctly without some hints.

The `properties` parameter recognizes any key with a hash value that contains two keys: `dsc_type` and `dsc_properties`, as a indication of how to format the data supplied. The `dsc_type` contains the CimInstance name to use, and the `dsc_properties` contains a hash or an array of hashes, representing the data for the CimInstances.

A contrived, but simple example follows:

~~~puppet
dsc {'foo':
  resource_name        => 'xFoo',
  module      => 'xFooBar',
  properties  => {
    ensure  => 'present',
    fooinfo => {
      'dsc_type'       => 'FooBarBaz',
      'dsc_properties' => {
        "wakka"      => "woot",
        "number"     => 8090
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

### Specifying a DSC Resource version

When there is more than one version installed for a given DSC Resource module, you must specify the version in your declaration. You can specify the version with similar syntax to a DSC configuration script, by using a hash containing the name and version of the DSC Resource module.

~~~puppet
dsc {'iis_server':
  resource_name   => 'WindowsFeature',
  module => {
    name    => 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration',
    version => '1.1'
  },
  properties  => {
    ensure => 'present',
    name   => 'Web-Server',
  }
}
~~~

### Distributing DSC Resources

There are several methods to distribute DSC Resources to the target nodes for the `dsc_lite` module to use.

#### PowerShell Gallery

You can choose to install DSC Resources using a mechanism that calls the builtin PowerShell package management system called `PackageManagement`. It uses the `PowerShellGet` module and pulls from the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com). You are responsible for orchestrating this before Puppet is run on the host, or you can do so using `exec` in your Puppet manifest. This gives you control of the process, but requires you to manage the complexity yourself.

The following example shows how to install the `xPSDesiredStateConfiguration` DSC Resource, and can be extended to support different DSC Resource names. This example assumes a package repository has been configured.

~~~puppet
exec { 'xPSDesiredStateConfiguration-Install':
  command   => 'Install-Module -Name xPSDesiredStateConfiguration -Force',
  provider  => 'powershell',
}
~~~

#### Puppet hbuckle/powershellmodule module

The community created module [hbuckle/powershellmodule](https://forge.puppet.com/hbuckle/powershellmodule) handles using `PackageMangement` and `PowerShellGet` to download and install DSC Resources on target nodes. It is another Puppet `package` provider, so it similar to how you install packages with Puppet for any other use case.

Installing a DSC Resource can be as simple as the following declaration:

~~~puppet
package { 'xPSDesiredStateConfiguration':
  ensure   => latest,
  provider => 'windowspowershell',
  source   => 'PSGallery',
}
~~~

The module supports configuring repository sources and other `PackageManagement` options, for example configuring trusted package repositories and private or on-premise package sources. For more information, please see the [forge page](https://forge.puppet.com/hbuckle/powershellmodule).

#### Chocolatey

Puppet already works well with [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/). You can create chocolatey packages that wrap the DSC Resources you need. 

~~~puppet
package { 'xPSDesiredStateConfiguration':
  ensure   => latest,
  provider => 'chocolatey',
}
~~~

This works well for users that already have a chocolatey source feed setup internally, as all you need to do is to push the DSC Resource chocolatey packages to the internal feed. If you use the community feed, you will have to check that the DSC Resource you use is present there.

### Using PSCredential or MSFT_Credential

Specifying credentials in DSC Resources requires using a PSCredential object. The `dsc` type automatically creates a PSCredential if the `dsc_type` has `MSFT_Credential` as a value.

~~~puppet
dsc {'foouser':
  resource_name       => 'User',
  module     => 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration',
  properties => {
    'username'    => 'jane-doe',
    'description' => 'Jane Doe user',
    'ensure'      => 'present',
    'password'    => {
      'dsc_type'       => 'MSFT_Credential',
      'dsc_properties' => {
        'user'     => 'jane-doe',
        'password' => 'StartFooo123&^!'
      }
    },
    'passwordneverexpires' => false,
    'disabled'             => true,
  }
}
~~~

Some DSC Resources require a password or passphrase for a setting, but do not need a user name. All credentials in DSC must be a PSCredential, so these passwords still have to be specified in a PSCredential format, even if there is no `user` to specify. How you specify the PSCredential depends on how the DSC Resource implemented the password requirement. Some DSC Resources accept an empty or null string for `user`, others do not. If it does not accept an empty or null string, then specify a dummy value. Do not use `undef` as it will error out.

You can also use the Puppet [Sensitive type](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_data_sensitive.html) to ensure logs and reports redact the password.

~~~puppet
dsc {'foouser':
  resource_name       => 'User',
  module     => 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration',
  properties => {
    'username'    => 'jane-doe',
    'description' => 'Jane Doe user',
    'ensure'      => 'present',
    'password'    => {
      'dsc_type'       => 'MSFT_Credential',
      'dsc_properties' => {
        'user'     => 'jane-doe',
        'password' => Sensitive('StartFooo123&^!')
      }
    },
    'passwordneverexpires' => false,
    'disabled'             => true,
  }
}
~~~

### Using CimInstance

A DSC Resource may need a more complex type than a simple key value pair, for example, an EmbeddedInstance. An EmbeddedInstance is serialized as CimInstance over the wire. In order to represent a CimInstance in the `dsc` type, use the `dsc_type` key to specify which CimInstance to use. If the CimInstance is an array, append a `[]` to the end of the name.

For example, create a new IIS website using the xWebSite DSC Resource, bound to port 80. Use `dsc_type` to specify a `MSFT_xWebBindingInformation` CimInstance, and append `[]` to indicate that it is an array. Note that you do this even if you are only putting a single value in `dsc_properties`.

~~~puppet
dsc {'NewWebsite':
  resource_name        => 'xWebsite',
  module      => 'xWebAdministration',
  properties  => {
    ensure       => 'Present',
    state        => 'Started',
    name         => 'TestSite',
    physicalpath => 'C:\testsite',
    bindinginfo  => {
      'dsc_type'       => 'MSFT_xWebBindingInformation[]',
      'dsc_properties' => {
        "protocol" => "HTTP",
        "port"     => 80
      }
    }
  }
}
~~~

To show using more than one value in `dsc_properties`, create the same site but bound to both port 80 and 443.

~~~puppet
dsc {'NewWebsite':
  resource_name        => 'xWebsite',
  module      => 'xWebAdministration',
  properties  => {
    ensure       => 'Present',
    state        => 'Started',
    name         => 'TestSite',
    physicalpath => 'C:\testsite',
    bindinginfo  => {
      'dsc_type'       => 'MSFT_xWebBindingInformation[]',
      'dsc_properties' => [
        {
          "protocol" => "HTTP",
          "port"     => 80
        },
        {
          'protocol'              => 'HTTPS',
          'port'                  => 443,
          'certificatethumbprint' => 'F94B4CC4C445703388E418F82D1BBAA6F3E9E512',
          'certificatestorename'  => 'My',
          'ipaddress'             => '*'
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
~~~

### Handling reboots with DSC

Add the following `reboot` resource to your manifest. It must have the name `dsc_reboot` for the `dsc` module to find and use it.

~~~puppet
reboot { 'dsc_reboot' :
  message => 'DSC has requested a reboot',
  when    => 'pending'
}
~~~

## Reference

### Types and Providers

#### dsc

The `dsc` type allows specifying any DSC Resource declaration as a minimal Puppet declaration.

### Properties/Parameters

#### name

The name of the declaration. This has no affect on the DSC Resource declaration and is not used by the DSC Resource.

#### ensure

An optional property that specifies the DSC resource should be invoked.
This property has only one value of `present`.
This property does not need be be set in manifests.

#### resource_name

The name of the DSC Resource to use. For example, the xRemoteFile DSC Resource.

#### module

The name of the DSC Resource module to use. For example, the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration DSC Resource module contains the xRemoteFile DSC Resource.

#### properties

The hash of properties to pass to the DSC Resource.

To express EmbeddedInstances, the `properties` parameter recognizes any key with a hash value that contains two keys — `dsc_type` and `dsc_properties` — as a indication of how to format the data supplied. The `dsc_type` contains the CimInstance name to use, and the `dsc_properties` contains a hash or an array of hashes representing the data for the CimInstances. If the CimInstance is an array, we append a `[]` to the end of the name.

## Limitations

* For a list of tradeoffs and improvements in the dsc_lite module compared to the dsc module, see [README_Tradeoffs.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-dsc_lite/blob/master/README_Tradeoffs.md)
* DSC Composite Resources are not supported.
* DSC requires PowerShell `Execution Policy` for the `LocalMachine` scope to be set to a less restrictive setting than `Restricted`. If you see the error below, see [MODULES-2500](https://tickets.puppet.com/browse/MODULES-2500) for more information.

  ~~~
  Error: /Stage[main]/Main/Dsc_xgroup[testgroup]: Could not evaluate: Importing module MSFT_xGroupResource failed with
  error - File C:\Program
  Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\PuppetVendoredModules\xPSDesiredStateConfiguration\DscResources\MSFT_xGroupR
  esource\MSFT_xGroupResource.psm1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more
  information, see about_Execution_Policies at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.
  ~~~

* You cannot use forward slashes for the MSI `Path` property for the `Package` DSC Resource. The underlying implementation does not accept forward slashes instead of backward slashes in paths, and it throws a misleading error that it could not find a Package with the Name and ProductId provided. See [MODULES-2486](https://tickets.puppet.com/browse/MODULES-2486) for more examples and information on this subject.
* Using this module with the 3.8.x x86 version of Puppet is highly discouraged, though it is supported.  Normally, this module employs a technique to dramatically improve performance by reusing a PowerShell process to execute DSC related commands.  However, due to the Ruby 1.9.3 runtime used with the 3.8.x x86 version of Puppet, this technique must be disabled, resulting in at least a 2x slowdown.

### Known Issues

`--noop` mode, `puppet resource` and property change notifications are currently not implemented. See [MODULES-2270](https://tickets.puppet.com/browse/MODULES-2270) for details.

### Running Puppet and DSC without administrative privileges

While there are options for using Puppet with a non-administrative account, DSC is limited to accounts with administrative privileges. The underlying CIM implementation DSC uses for DSC Resource invocation, and the Invoke-DscResource cmdlet, require administrative credentials.

The Puppet agent on a Windows node can run DSC with a normal default install. If the Puppet agent is configured to use an alternate user account, it must have administrative privileges on the system to run DSC.

## Troubleshooting

When Puppet runs, the dsc_lite module takes the code supplied in your Puppet manifest and converts it into PowerShell code that is sent directly to the DSC engine using `Invoke-DscResource`. You can see both the commands sent and the result of this by running Puppet interactively, for example, `puppet apply --debug`. It outputs the PowerShell code that is sent to DSC to execute and return data from DSC. For example:

```puppet
Notice: Compiled catalog for win2012r2 in environment production in 0.82 seconds
Debug: Creating default schedules
Debug: Loaded state in 0.03 seconds
Debug: Loaded state in 0.05 seconds

property2 = 'value2'
}
ModuleName = 'ExampleDscResourceModule'
}
############### SNIP ################

############### SNIP ################
$invokeParams = @{

Method        = 'set'
Property      = @{

property2 = 'value2'
}
ModuleName = 'ExampleDscResourceModule'
}
############### SNIP ################\
Debug: Waited 100 total milliseconds.
Debug: Create Dsc Resource returned: {"rebootrequired":false,"indesiredstate":true,"errormessage":""}

Debug: Stored state in 0.10 seconds
############### SNIP ################
```

This shows us that there wasn't a problem parsing the manifest and turning it into a command to send to DSC. It also shows that there are two commands/operations for every DSC Resource executed, a SET and a test. DSC operates in two stages, it first tests if a system is in the desired state, and then it sets the state of the system to the desired state. You can see the result of each operation in the debug log.

By using the debug logging of a Puppet run, you can troubleshoot the application of DSC Resources during the development of your Puppet manifests.

## Development

Puppet modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We can’t access the huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

For more information, see our [module contribution guide.](https://docs.puppet.com/forge/contributing.html)
