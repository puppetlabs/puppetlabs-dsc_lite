## Resource types

### base_dsc_lite

The base Puppet DSC type that all of the types inherit from.
Do not use this directly.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `base_dsc_lite` type.

##### `name`

namevar

A name to describe your resource, used for uniqueness.

### dsc

The `dsc` type allows specifying any DSC Resource declaration as a minimal Puppet declaration.

#### Examples

##### 

```puppet
dsc {'iis':
  resource_name => 'WindowsFeature',
  module        => 'PSDesiredStateConfiguration',
  properties    => {
    ensure => 'present',
    name   => 'Web-Server',
  }
}
```

#### Properties

The following properties are available in the `dsc` type.

##### `ensure`

Valid values: present

An optional property that specifies that the DSC resource should be invoked.

#### Parameters

The following parameters are available in the `dsc` type.

##### `name`

namevar

Name of the declaration. This has no affect on the DSC Resource declaration and is not used by the DSC Resource.

##### `resource_name`

Name of the DSC Resource to use. For example, the xRemoteFile DSC Resource.

##### `module`

Name of the DSC Resource module to use. For example, the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration DSC Resource module contains
the xRemoteFile DSC Resource.

##### `properties`

Hash of properties to pass to the DSC Resource.

To express EmbeddedInstances, the `properties` parameter recognizes any key with a hash value that contains two keys — `dsc_type`
and `dsc_properties` — as a indication of how to format the data supplied. The `dsc_type` contains the CimInstance name to use,
and the `dsc_properties` contains a hash or an array of hashes representing the data for the CimInstances. If the CimInstance is
an array, we append a `[]` to the end of the name.
